# Aurora

Aurora is a World of Warcraft addon that restyles the default Blizzard interface to a clean, minimalistic theme consistent across the entire UI.

A single accent color — matching your class or a custom choice — is used for highlights and emphasis throughout every window and frame.

Fork of [Gethe/Aurora](https://github.com/Gethe/Aurora), maintained by LiQiuDgg for WoW Retail (Midnight 12.0+).

## Install

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/UnstableGuild/Aurora/releases) page and extract to your `Interface/AddOns/` folder.
